\begin{block}{Monads, Comonads, Applicative Functors \ldots}
All just the names of common interfaces.
\begin{itemize}
\item with many distinct and disparate instances.
\item with many derived operations.
\end{itemize}
Each making different trade-offs for differences in utility.

\begin{block}{When might I use any of these interfaces?}
The same reason we already use interfaces.
\end{block}
Begin with a simple principle and exploit its diversity \emph{to abstract away code repetition}.

\begin{block}{If these interfaces are so useful, why aren't they used everywhere?}
\begin{itemize}
\item familiarity
\item expressibility

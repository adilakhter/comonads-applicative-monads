\begin{block}{Monads, Comonads, Applicative Functors \ldots}
All just the names of common interfaces.
\begin{itemize}
\item with many distinct and disparate instances.
\item with many derived operations.
\end{itemize}
Each making different trade-offs for differences in utility.
\end{block}

% ok, so if monads, etc are just interfaces:
%   How useful are they?
%   Why don't we see them used everywhere?
